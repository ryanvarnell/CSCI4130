**Instructions for compiling and running the program**
As long as you have the latest version of Java, it should run just fine.

The program will need access to the Cranfield collection's 'cran.qry', 'cran-1.all.1400', and 'cranqrel' files.
The assumed directory structure is something like:

|[Parent Folder]
|   |[src]
|   |   ProjectThree.java
|   cran.qry
|   cran-1.all.1400
|   cranqrel

I was able to successfully automate testing the queries, but I think my MAP calculator is broken.
